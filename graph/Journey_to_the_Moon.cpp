The question demands the concept of using disjoint sets. (find and union with rank and path compression).

However, this method below using DFS also works (which I think i pretty similar to the editorial) :

We need to find the distinct sets (i.e. if x and y are from same country, they belong to same set) to get the answer. Let's say set A has a elements,set B has b elements.

Answer = a x b. [Because actual formula is to select one from set A and another one from set B = aC1 x bC1 = a x b]

Similarly, let's calculate answer for 4 sets - A,B,C,D with a,b,c,d elements respectively.

Lets say somehow I find set A has a elements.

Answer = 0 (Since I don't have another country to pair with)

Now, I find set B with b elements.

Answer = axb; .................................................(1)

Then, I find set C with c elements.

Answer = (axb) + (axc) + (bxc) [because we can select a pair from A and B, or A and C or B and C]

But this can be written as

Answer = (axb) + (a+b)xc ......................................(2)

Now I find set D with d elements, and I've examined all people.

Answer = (axb) + (axc) + (axd) + (bxc) + (bxd) + (cxd)

Or

Answer = (axb) x (a+b)xc + (a+b+c)xd ..........................(3)

Do you see the pattern? That means when we find a new set, the new answer is the old answer + the sum of old values x new value.
